Behaviours
---

Unlike a classical entity-component pattern, compontents in Elysion compatible game engines are divided into behaviours
and data models.

A behaviour can be added to:
* Entity
* Behaviour

A behaviour consists of an updatable part, which is being called by the parent objects it has been added to.
